# ShareReady

Move windows from Monitor 2 to Monitor 1.

**Use case:** Before starting a video conference with screen sharing, it is essential to move all open windows to the monitor that will not be shared, avoiding accidentally displaying personal content.

**Scenario:** You are going to share the screen of Monitor 2 in Teams/Zoom/Slack and want to ensure that no personal windows (WhatsApp, Notepad with passwords, etc.) are visible there.

## Requirements
