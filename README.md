Automation scripts to accelerate digital life

Collection of **personal automations and configurations** developed to improve keyboard ergonomics and reduce time spent on repetitive tasks in my own digital world. I share them here in the hope that they may be useful as a reference guide or as inspiration for others, but **without guarantees**.

Everything in this repository represents personal solutions to specific problems, given the assumptions of my hardware, operating system, and workflow.

The scripts here will probably not work on your machine immediately. For them to function correctly in your particular case, adjustments may be necessary.

- **OnlyLetter:** Keyboard remapping and global hotkeys to concentrate typing on letter keys.
- **ShareReady:** Move windows from Monitor 2 to Monitor 1. To prepare for screen sharing.
- **Camset:** Auto-adjust webcam settings via the Windows Video Proc Amp dialog.
